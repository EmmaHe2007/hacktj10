## Inspiration
Traditional household products often contain plastic or other chemicals that are toxic to the environment. Our mission is to create a cleaner, greener planet. Currently, many people aren't aware of the eco-friendly products that are available. We made a website that could help people can easily find eco-friendly alternatives to common products. 
## What it does
EcoSwap compiles and allows you to purchase the best eco-friendly alternatives to common household items. Some example include straws, soaps, and cleaning supplies.
## How we built it
Using HTML and CSS, we built a website with a menu that includes: Home, Search, Categories, and About Us pages.
## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the course of this hackathon we ran into many problems. For example, we had to learn how to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code overnight, which often led to minor technical errors and an inefficient work process.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to develop a somewhat aesthetic website without any prior knowledge of website building. Being completely new to the languages, we were forced to troubleshoot and learn them on our own.
## What we learned
We also learned how to write code using CSS and HTML. Throughout the whole process we solved many problems and persevered through our struggles.
## What's next for EcoSwap
If we were to continue to develop this website we would make it easier to navigate such as adding filters for product categories, price, and ratings. In addition, we would add images to the products so that it would be more readable and add more products to our website.
